# Privacy and Data Collection

This project collects a small set of information to power analytics and mapping features.

## Data Categories

### Focus Labels
Tags describing reading or activity focus are stored to highlight trends and surface relevant insights. These labels help the application customise charts and recommendations.

### Location History
Latitude/longitude fixes are stored locally so the application can build visit summaries and route visualisations. Location data never leaves the device unless exported manually.

### App Usage
Basic usage information such as chart selections or feature toggles is kept to remember preferences and improve usability.

## Retention Policy
All locally stored data is subject to a configurable retention period (30 days by default). Entries older than the selected window are purged automatically.

## Export & Deletion
The privacy dashboard provides buttons to export all stored data as a JSON file or delete it entirely. Clearing data also removes any associated history and retention timers.
