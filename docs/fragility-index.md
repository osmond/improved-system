# Fragility Index

The fragility index measures how many outcome flips are needed to change a statistically significant result to non-significant.

## Glossary

### 2Ã—2 Table
A contingency table summarizing events and non-events across two groups.

### P-value
Probability of observing results at least as extreme as those measured, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

### Fisher's exact test
A statistical test used for small-sample contingency tables to compute an exact p-value.

### Fragility Index
The number of individual outcome flips required to render a significant result non-significant.
