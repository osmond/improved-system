# Fragility Index Examples

## Case Study 1: Low FI
| Outcome | Treatment | Control |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Event   | 10        | 3       |
| No Event| 10        | 17      |

Fragility Index: **1**

A single outcome flip in the control group (from non-event to event) would make the result non-significant, indicating a fragile finding.

## Case Study 2: Higher FI
| Outcome | Treatment | Control |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Event   | 13        | 1       |
| No Event| 7         | 19      |

Fragility Index: **5**

It would take five outcome reversals in the control group to overturn significance, making this result more robust though still dependent on sample size.
